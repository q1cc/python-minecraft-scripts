== Overview

Experimental minecraft-server control script.
Features:

* Starts self in a tmux session
* Downloads fabric launcher
* Syncs mods with mods directory from a zip file
* Starts a fabric server
* Broadcasts server to LAN

== Missing features and bugs

* Does not handle terminal input nicely
* Does not check the server port yet
* Broadcasts even before the server is up
* Missing proper logging (logs a bunch of crap and should output as json and to a file)

== TODO

Use a library instead of writing my own async handling -- candidates:
